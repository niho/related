Related
=======

Related is a Redis-backed high performance distributed graph database.

Raison d'Ãªtre
-------------

Related is meant to be a simple graph database that is fun, free and easy to
use. The intention is not to compete with "real" graph databases like Neo4j,
but rather to be a replacement for a relational database when your data is
better described as a graph. For example when building social software.
Related is very similar in scope and functionality to Twitters FlockDB, but is
among other things designed to be easier to setup and use. Related also has
better documentation and is easier to hack on. The intention is to be web
scale, but we ultimately rely on the ability of Redis to scale (using Redis
Cluster for example). Read more about the philosophy behind Related in the
[Wiki](http://github.com/sutajio/related/wiki).

Setup
-----

Assuming you already have Redis installed:

    $ gem install related

Or add the gem to your Gemfile.

```ruby
require 'related'
Related.redis = 'redis://.../'
```

If you are using Rails, add the above to an initializer. If Redis is running
on localhost and on the default port the second line is not needed.

Example usage
-------------

```ruby
node = Related::Node.create(:name => 'Example', :popularity => 2.3)
node.new?
node.popularity = 100
node.attributes
node.has_attribute?(:popularity)
node.read_attribute(:popularity)
node.write_attribute(:popularity, 50)
node.increment!(:popularity, 10)
node.decrement!(:popularity, 10)
Related::Node.increment!(node, :popularity, 10)
Related::Node.decrement!(node, :popularity, 10)
node.save
node.persisted?
node = Related::Node.find(node.id)
node.destroy
node.destroyed?

node1 = Related::Node.create
node2 = Related::Node.create
rel = Related::Relationship.create(:friends, node1, node2, :have_met => true)

n = Related::Node.find(node1.id)
nn = Related::Node.find(node1.id, node2.id)

n = Related::Node.find(node1.id, :fields => [:name])
nn = Related::Node.find(node1.id, node2.id, :fields => [:name])
```

Nodes and relationships are both sub-classes of the same base class and both
behave similar to an ActiveRecord object and can store attributes etc.

To query the graph:

```ruby
node.outgoing(:friends)
node.incoming(:friends)
node.outgoing(:friends).relationships
node.outgoing(:friends).nodes
node.outgoing(:friends).limit(5)
node.outgoing(:friends).options(:fields => ..., :model => ...)
node1.outgoing(:friends).relationships.find(node2)
node1.path_to(node2).outgoing(:friends).depth(3)
node1.shortest_path_to(node2).outgoing(:friends).depth(3)
```

To get the results from a query:

```ruby
node.outgoing(:friends).to_a
node.outgoing(:friends).count (or .size, which is memoized)
```

You can also do set operations, like union, diff and intersect:

```ruby
node1.outgoing(:friends).union(node2.outgoing(:friends))
node1.outgoing(:friends).diff(node2.outgoing(:friends))
node1.outgoing(:friends).intersect(node2.outgoing(:friends))
```

Relationships are sorted based on when they were created, which means you can
paginate them:

```ruby
node.outgoing(:friends).relationships.per_page(100).page(1)
node.outgoing(:friends).relationships.per_page(100).page(rel)
```

The second form paginates based on the id of the last relationship on the
previous page. Useful for cases where explicit page numbers are not
appropriate.

Pagination only works for relationships. If you want to access nodes directly
without going through the extra step of iterating through the relationship
objects you will only get random nodes. Thus you can use .limit (or .per_page)
like this to get a random selection of nodes:

```ruby
node.outgoing(:friends).nodes.limit(5)
```

The root node
-------------

Related provides a special kind of node called the "root" node. It's always
accessible using the `Related.root` helper and you can create a relationship
between any node and the root node, which is useful if you want to easily
access a set of nodes without knowing the IDs of those nodes.

```ruby
Related::Relationship.create(:example, Related.root, node)
Related.root.outgoing(:example)
```

You can even add attributes to the root node if you want.

```ruby
Related.root.name = 'The root'
Related.root.save
```

Properties
----------

All Node and Relationship attributes are stored as strings in Redis, but you
can easily create your own subclass and define your own custom serialization
behavior. You can either just override the getter and setter methods for the
attribute you need to convert or you can use the `property` method to define
the semantics and let Related do the conversion for you.

```ruby
class Event < Related::Node
  property :title, String
  property :attending_count, Integer
  property :popularity, Float
  property :start_date, DateTime
  property :location do |value|
    "http://maps.google.com/maps?q=#{value}"
  end
end
```

An additional benefit of defining properties like this is that they get
included when you serialize the object to JSON or XML even when the attribute
hasn't been set.

```ruby
event = Event.create(:title => 'Party!', :location => 'Stockholm')
event.as_json # => {"title"=>"Party!","attending_count"=>nil,"popularity"=>nil,"start_date"=>nil,"location"=>"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Stockholm"}
```

When querying the graph you may want the query to return the results as your
custom model class instead of as a Related::Node or Related::Relationship.
Related allows you to specify what model a specific node or relationship
should be instantiated as based on its attributes.

```ruby
Related::Node.find(...,
  :model => lambda {|attributes|
    attributes['start_date'] ? Event : Related::Node
  }
)

node.outgoing(:attending).options(
  :model => lambda {|attributes|
    attributes['start_date'] ? Event : Related::Node
  }
)
```

You can also specify a simple model class if you don't need to dynamically
instantiate different model classes based on an attribute.

```ruby
Related::Node.find(..., :model => Event)
```

Weight
------

All relationships have an associated weight on its incoming and outgoing
links. By default the weight is set to the time when the relationship was
created. That makes the result from a query that fetches relationships always
sorted so that newer relationships appear first, which is nice. If you create
a custom Related::Relationship sub-class you can define how the weight is
generated for a relationship.

```ruby
class Comment < Related::Relationship
  property :created_at, Time
  property :points, Integer
  weight do |direction|
    if direction == :in
      self.created_at
    elsif direction == :out
      self.points
    end
  end
end
```

The weight is always a double precision floating point number and is sorted in
descending order.

To change the weight an existing relationship you can use the
`increment_weight!` and `decrement_weight!` methods. They are atomic, which
means that you can have any number of clients updating the weight
simultaneously without conflict.

```ruby
comment.increment_weight!(:out, 4.2)
comment.decrement_weight!(:in, 4.2)
```

You can access the current weight and rank (0 based position) of a
relationship like this:

```ruby
comment.weight(:out)
comment.rank(:in)
```

ActiveModel
-----------

Related supports ActiveModel and includes some basic functionality in both
nodes and relationships like validations, callbacks, JSON and XML
serialization and translation support. You can easily extend your own sub
classes with the custom ActiveModel functionality that you need.

```ruby
class Like < Related::Relationship
  validates_presence_of :how_much
  validates_numericality_of :how_much

  after_save :invalidate_cache

  def invalidate_cache
    ...
  end
end
```

Follower
--------

Related includes a helper module called Related::Follower that you can include
in your node sub-class to get basic Twitter-like follow functionality:

```ruby
require 'related/follower'

class User < Related::Node
  include Related::Follower
end

user1 = User.create
user2 = User.create

user1.follow!(user2)
user1.unfollow!(user2)
user2.followers
user1.following
user1.friends
user2.followed_by?(user1)
user1.following?(user2)
user2.followers_count
user1.following_count
```

The two nodes does not need to be of the same type. You can for example have
a User following a Page or whatever makes sense in your app.

Real-time Stream Processing
---------------------------

When working with graphs you often want to take the rich and interconnected
web of data and actually do something with it. Stream processing is a powerful
and flexible way to do that. It allows you to implement complex graph
algorithms in a scalable way that is also easy to understand and work with.

Stream processing in Related works by defining a data flow that new or
existing data will be streamed through. A data flow is triggered when a
Relationship is created, updated or deleted. You setup data flows for
different relationship types, so for example when a "friend" relationship
between two nodes is created or updated that relationship will be
automatically sent through the data flows you have defined for the "friend"
type.

A data flow can consist of one or more steps and can branch out in a tree.
You define the steps for a data flow using a simple Hash syntax.

```ruby
Related.data_flow :comment, Tokenize => { CountWords => { TotalSum => nil, MovingAverage => nil } }
```

In the example above a new comment will first sent to the Tokenize step that
will split the comment text into words. The list of words will then
automatically be sent to the CountWords step that will count the number of
unique words. That number will then be sent to both the TotalSum step that
adds the number to a global counter as well as the MovingAverage step that
will calculate and store a moving average. The nil indicates the end of the
data flow. You can define as many data flows for a relationship type as you
want.

A data flow step is simply a Ruby class that responds to the `process` message
and takes a single argument that holds the input data. Any data yielded from
the process method will be automatically sent to the next step in the data
flow. The only limitation is that the data sent between steps is a Hash and
only contains JSON serializable data. The first step in the data flow will
receive the Relationship object that triggered it as a Ruby hash with all of
its attributes.

```ruby
class Tokenize
  def self.process(data)
    data['text'].split(' ').each do |word|
      yield({ :word => word })
    end
  end
end
```

To actually run the data flows you have defined you need to start one or more
data flow workers. Related uses Resque which supplies persistent queues and
reliable workers. If you don't have Resque required in your application
Related will simply run the work flow directly in process instead which can
be useful when testing, but is not recommended for production.

To start a stream processor:

    $ QUEUE=related rake resque:work

You can start as many stream processors as you may need to scale
up.

Distributed cluster setup
-------------------------

It is easy to use Related in a distributed cluster setup. As of writing this
(November 2011) Redis Cluster is not yet ready for production use, but is
expected for Redis 3.0 sometime in 2012. Redis Cluster will then be the
preferred solution as it will allow you to setup up a dynamic cluster that can
re-configure on the fly. If you don't need to add or remove machines for the
cluster you can still use Related in a distributed setup right now using the
consistent hashing client Redis::Distributed which is included in the "redis"
gem.

```ruby
Related.redis = Redis::Distributed.new %w[
  redis://redis-1.example.com
  redis://redis-2.example.com
  redis://redis-3.example.com
  redis://redis-4.example.com],
  :tag => /^related:([^:]+)/
```

The regular expression supplied in the `:tag` option tells Redis::Distributed
how to distribute keys between the different machines. The regexp in the
example is the recommended way of setting it up as it will partition the key
space based on the Related ID part of the key, in effect localizing all data
directly related to a specific node on a single machine. This is generally
good both for reliability (if a machine goes down, it only takes down a part
of the graph) and speed (set operations on relationships originating from the
same node can be done on the server side, which is a lot faster, for example).

You could also specify a regexp like `/:(n|r):/` that will locate all
relationships on the same machine, making set operations on relationships
a lot faster overall. But with the obvious drawback that the total size of
your graph will be limited by that single machine.

Using Related with another database
-----------------------------------

Related can easily be used together with other databases than Redis to store
Node data. Relationships are always stored in Redis, but node data can often
have characteristics that make Redis unsuitable (like large size).

You can for example use Related together with the Ripple gem to store nodes
in Riak:

```ruby
class CustomNode
  include Ripple::Document
  include Related::Node::QueryMethods

  def query
    Related::Node::Query.new(self)
  end
end
```

You can then use the `CustomNode` class as an ordinary Related graph Node and
query the graph like usual:

```ruby
node1 = CustomNode.create
node2 = CustomNode.create
Related::Relationship.create(:friend, node1, node2)
node1.shortest_path_to(node2).outgoing(:friend)
```
